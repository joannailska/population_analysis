The scripts were used to run a population analysis on pedigree dog data extracted from The Kennel Club's (UK) database. 
The analyses were initially carried out on each breed data, and provided a number of parameters which will be shared with breed
communities with the goal of developing breed-specific management plans. The script for the analysis is in pop_analysis_v2.py, 
with functions sourced from pop_analysis_functions_v2.py.

The within breed results were later combined in across breed analyses. The first part, concerning primary demographics and 
characteristics of breeding dogs is included in q_paper_analyses.html
